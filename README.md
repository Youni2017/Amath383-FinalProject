## Abstract  

Population aging is becoming a significant challenge in the modern era due to rising life expectancy and declining fertility rates in the United States. This trend increases the demand for a sustainable workforce to care for the aging population. To address this issue, we propose the **Population Aging Transition Model (PATM)**—a system of differential equations designed to simulate demographic shifts across three age groups:  
1. Individuals below working age  
2. Individuals of working age  
3. Individuals above working age  

By leveraging differential equations and incorporating key parameters such as birth rate, immigration factor, death rate, and transition rates between these categories, our model evaluates the sustainability of the labor force amidst population aging.  

Based on our model, we predict that adjusting the birth rate plays a critical role in mitigating the age imbalance between individuals below working age and those above working age. Furthermore, we propose an optimal birth rate to balance demographic needs. Future work includes dynamically modeling the birth rate and adapting the model to other national contexts.
